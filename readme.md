## Description
This image search engine uses JavaScript and the GIPHY API to search for and return images using keyword and number of GIF's input fields. Specifically, the websire returns and displays a chosen number of images based on the user-selected keyword at a rate of 100 calls per hour (based on GIPHY API use limits). This website also provides a contact section and form that can be used to contact the website developer. This website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Usage
This website is used to return and display images based on user-selected keywords and number of desired images form fields. The default theme is "wild west movies", but can easily be bachged by entering a new keyword/search query. The contact section in the website navbar is linked to a form that can be used to contact the website developer. **Form responses are uploaded and organized using formspree.io.**

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Future Improvements
- [Feature 1]: Make a separate page on the same website that returns and displays stickers instead of GIF's.
- [Feature 2]: Allow the user to download all returned images to their local device.
- [Feature 3]: Allow the user to submit the form using the return button on a keyboard, rather than having to click the submit button.
